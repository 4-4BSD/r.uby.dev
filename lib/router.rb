      Here's to the crazy ones.
      The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
      The round pegs in the square holes - the ones who see things differently.
      They're not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo.
      You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them,
      glorify or vilify them. About the only thing that you can't do is ignore them.
      Because they change things.
